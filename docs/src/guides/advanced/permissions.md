## Permissions

Permissions are defined by `IPermissionPolicy` objects, which are considered platform business rules. They are stored in the `<Entity>BusinessRules.ts` modules, and should not be exported from Hub.js.

For an overview of how permissons work, see the [Access Control Guide](../access-control)

### Permission Policy Properties

**Permission**: Permission Identifier. e.g. `hub:projects:create`

**dependencies**: Array of other permissions this permission depends on. This allows for the creation of hiearchies, with reduces duplication

**services**: What services must be online for this policy?

**authenticated**: must user be authenticated?

**privileges**: Any Platform level privileges that may be required. e.g. `portal:user:createItem`. User must have all specified privileges.

**entityOwner**: Does this policy require that the user be the owner of the entity?

**entityEdit**: Does this policy require that the user be able to edit the entity?

**licenses**: What Hub Licenses are required? Only specify this if the permission is limited to a subset of licenses.

**availability**: `alpha`, `beta` or `general` availability. Can be overridden by passing `?pe=permission:to:enable` in uri

**environments**: `devext`, `qaext` or `production` etc. Can be overridden by passing `?pe=permission:to:enable` in uri

**assertions**: additional checks that can address custom scenarios not covered by the other properties. (example shown below)

**entityConfigurable**: can an entity enable/disable this?

Please see the [`IPermissionPolicy` documentation](/hub.js/api/common/IPermissionPolicy/) for list of all available properties and theur detailed definitions.

#### Example Annotated Policy

```js
// This is an example - there are many more Site permissions
export const SitesPermissionPolicies: IPermissionPolicy[] = [
  {
    // Top level policy
    permission: "hub:site",
    services: ["portal"],
    // since sites are available for all license levels
    // we don't need to specify any licenses
  },
  {
    permission: "hub:site:edit",
    // this permission depends on hub:site
    dependencies: ["hub:site"],
    // and adds a requirement that the user be
    // authenticated, and have edit access to the site
    authenticated: true,
    entityEdit: true,
  },
  {
    // this permission controls access to the domain editing UX
    permission: "hub:site:edit:domain",
    // by default, it's the same as hub:site:edit
    // but by having a separate permission, the site can
    // add more rules... see the next section
    dependencies: ["hub:site:edit"],
    // we also stipulate that it depends on the domains service
    // so if that's down, we can have a gracefully degraded UX
    services: ["domains"],
  },
  {
    permission: "hub:site:workspace:followers:manager",
    dependencies: ["hub:site:edit"],
    // example of an assertion used to implement an
    // entity specific rule
    assertions: [
      {
        // Access to this permission requires that the current user
        // is an admin of the followers group. To do that we
        // look up a property on the context
        property: "context:currentUser",
        // choose the type of assertion
        type: "is-group-admin",
        // look up a property from the entity
        value: "entity:followersGroupId",
        // see the IPolicyAssertion type for more information
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    // Example of a new feature...
    permission: "hub:site:workspace:chat",
    // that requires edit access
    dependencies: ["hub:site:edit"],
    // hub-premium license and is gated to alpha orgs in qaext
    licenses: ["hub-premium"],
    availability: ["alpha"],
    environments: ["qaext"],
    // this allows a site entity to turn this off
    // see Entity Feature Flags below
    entityConfigurable: true,
  },
];
```

### Entity Permission Policies

Entities can add additional "gating" for specific permissions. For example, a Site owner (`jsmith`) may choose to limit domain editing to themselves. So on the site entity, an `IEntityPermissionPolicy` would be added to the `.permissions` array, adding that conditition to the existing `IPermissionPolicy`

```js
site.permissions = [
  {
    permission: "hub:site:edit:domain",
    collaborationType: "user",
    collaborationId: "jsmith",
  },
];
```

Entity Permission Policies are more limited than the full `IPermissionPolicy`, but they can cover a wide range of collaboration scenarios

- is the current user a member of a specified group?
- is the current user a member of a specified org?
- is the current user specifically granted access by name? (as shown above)

Entities can define many policies for the same permission, and only one of those needs to pass.

```js
// In this example jsmith or dvader will be granted access to hub:site:edit:domain
site.permissions = [
  {
    permission: "hub:site:edit:domain",
    collaborationType: "user",
    collaborationId: "jsmith",
  },
  {
    permission: "hub:site:edit:domain",
    collaborationType: "user",
    collaborationId: "dvader",
  },
];
```

### Entity Features

Individual entities can disable "features" (which are represented by a permission). This is done by adding a key for the permission into the `entity.features` hash. Only permissions with `.entityConfigurable:true` will be read from this hash, ensuring general business rules can not be overridden.

```js
site.features = {
  // although the general business rules in the example above
  // allow sites to have the chat "feature",
  // by adding an entry for that permission, we can turn it off
  "hub:site:workspace:chat": false,
  // NOTE: these values are only read if the permission policy specifically
  // allows the permission to be "configured" by the entity
  // by specifying entityConfigurable:true
};
```

### System Feature Flags

Hub.js also supports system feature flags. These are passed into the `ArcGISContextManager.create(...)` as part of the options. The host application is responsible for parsing the values from the url.

System Feature Flags will override any Entity Feature flags, as well as the `availability` and `environment` checks. They can not be used to override license level checks, nor any core platform level privileges.

These are typically used to demonstrate upcoming features in customer Production orgs, despite the feature being gated to `qaext`.

Feature Flags are reset when the user formally signs out of the running application.

### System Service Flags

As noted, Permission policies can list the services they depend upon (see the `hub:site:edit:domains` definition). In order to test our graceful degradation UX, we need a means to simulate a service being offline.

Similar to System Feature Flags, these are passed into `ArcGISContextManager.create(...)` as part of the options, and override the live status information.

Service Flags are reset when the user formally signs out of the running application.

### Feature Gating & User Opt-in/out

During development, features are often gated—accessible only when a specific URI parameter is present or when the app runs in certain environments or availability modes (e.g., "alpha"). As release approaches, you may want to let users opt in to preview features. After general release, you may allow users to opt out for a limited time.

#### Defining Gating and Feature Permissions

Start by defining both "gating" and "feature" permissions:

```js
{
  // Gating permission: cannot be overridden by user settings
  permission: "hub:gating:workspace:released",
  availability: ["alpha"],
  environments: ["devext", "qaext", "production"],
},
{
  // Feature permission: can be opted in or out by the user
  permission: "hub:feature:workspace",
  dependencies: ["hub:gating:workspace:released"],
},
```

#### User Opt-in/Opt-out

When users can opt in, provide a UI that updates the `IUserHubSettings.features` object. Initially, users are opted out by default:

```json
{
  "features": {
    "workspace": false
  }
}
```

To release the feature to all users, remove conditions from the gating permission:

```js
{
  permission: "hub:gating:workspace:released",
},
{
  permission: "hub:feature:workspace",
  dependencies: ["hub:gating:workspace:released"],
},
```

Update the `getDefaultUserHubSettings(...)` function so the feature is opted in by default:

```js
{
  schemaVersion: 1.1,
  username,
  updated: new Date().getTime(),
  features: {
    workspace: true,
  },
}
```

Update the UI to reflect the feature’s general availability. The boolean value should remain consistent: `true` means the user has the feature, `false` means they do not.

#### Ending the Opt-out Period

When the opt-out period ends, apply a schema migration to remove the feature property from `IUserHubSettings.features`. This prevents users from opting out, even manually, and allows you to remove legacy code.

### Checking Permission Access

Permissions can be checked directly on an Entity instance via the `instance.checkPermission(permission)` method. If you don’t have access to an Entity Instance, the `checkPermission(permission, context, entity?)` function is also available.

```jsx
// Check individual permission

checkPermission("hub:events:create", entity, context);

//=> {permission: "hub:events:create", access: false, response: "not-group-member", checks: [{"hub:events:create", value: "group:00c", response:"not-group-member"}]}
// same function will be exposed on the class instances

site.checkPermission("hub:pages:create");
//=> {permission: "hub:pages:create", access: true, response: "group-member", checks: [{"hub:pages:create", value: "group:00c", response:"group-member"}]}
```

Both return an `IPermissionAccessResponse` . The most important property is `.access` which indicates if the current user has access to the capability. The other properties are for debugging and observability into why the system is returning the `.access` value, and can be used to display different messages to the user.

For example, the `.result` property will be `granted` if access is allowed, but if access is denied, it will be a more informative value.

The table below lists all the values, but some of most important are:

**not-licensed-available** which means the feature is available, but user lacks a license. This is an opportunity to show an upgrade call-to-action

**service-offline** a required service is currently offline. Application can choose to show a general error message, or continue with a gracefully degraded experience.

**service-not-available** this means that the service is simply not available in the current environment. This is a good means to gate access to a feature that's not currently in Enterprise, but which we could add over time.

Most of the rest of the values are specific to some policy check failing.
