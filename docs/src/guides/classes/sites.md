In terms of ArcGIS Hub, Sites are the central domain entity. A Site is backed by an item, it has a [layout](/hub.js/api/common/IHubLayout/) that can include a header and footer, and a theme.

In ArcGIS Online, the item type is `Hub Site Application`

In ArcGIS Enterprise, the item type is `Site Application`

In both environments, we use Hub.js to work with sites via the `HubSite` class, which operates on `IHubSite` objects.
