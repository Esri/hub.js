### Hub Functional API

One level below the Hub.js Class API is the functional api. This layer is used by the classes to implement the behavior, but also hosts functions that implement all the other ArcGIS Hub business logic.

**Note** for most developers outside the ArGIS Hub Team, we strongly recommend using the Class based API.

### Domain Entities supported by Functions

The functional API provides the underlying implementation for Site, Page, Initiative and Project classes, as well as the implementation for Teams, Discussions, Posts, Events, and Surveys.
