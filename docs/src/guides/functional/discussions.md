As organizations use ArcGIS Hub to support community engagement and collaboration, **ArcGIS Hub Discussions** provides an integrated capability for organizations to meet their varied needs for internal & external collaborative communication around Hub initiatives, content and data.

Hub Discussions will be available in mid-2021 starting with private discussions within Hub Teams. Through the rest of the year, Hub Discussions will expand to support focused public feedback, dataset comments or corrections, and possibly public forums.

## Common Terms

A **Post** is created by a User that reference a _topic_ and _location_ within datasets, documents, teams, sites, and any Hub resource.

Users can **Reply** to a Post, or add a **Reaction** to quickly indicate support or other feeling.

Posts can be public or shared privately to a **Channel**. A Channel can include one or multiple Groups or Users.

# Getting Started

This is a quick introduction to using `@esri/hub-discussions` in your own application or service. You can find more details on each topic further below.

## Authentication

Authentication is provided using [arcgis-rest-js](https://github.com/esri/arcgis-rest-js).

```js
import { UserSession } from "@esri/arcgis-rest-auth";

const authentication = new UserSession({
  username: "jdoe",
  password: "########",
  portal: "https://www.arcgis.com/sharing/rest",
});
```

## Creating posts

To create a post using [createPost](https://esri.github.io/hub.js/api/discussions/createPost/).

The `post.discussion` is important as a reference for the Post to some content item. Currently `discussion` uses a URI like `hub://item/{itemId}`. This allows for getting all Posts about a content item using this property.

```js
import {
  createPost,
  ICreatePost,
  ICreatePostOptions,
} from "@esri/hub-discussions";

const params: ICreatePost = {
  title: "Question about updating trees dataset",
  body: "We need to add more details about tree planting date.",
  discussion: "hub://dataset/1234",
  channelId: "3efabc",
};

const opts: ICreatePostOptions = { authentication, params };

const myPost = await createPost(opts);
/*
myPost = IPost {
  id: 'abcdefg',
  ...
}
*/
```

# Posts

A Post is the primary forum for dialogue between users in a Channel. Posts are organized into "threads" using a self-join: a post can have many replies, or a post can belong to a single "parent" post. Posts are required to have a `body`, and optionally a `title` (perhaps best suited for parent posts). Posts may also encode a content subject (called `discussion`) and geography (called `geometry`). Posts additionally have a `status`, which dictates visibility and can currently be used by channel managers to employ light-weight moderation. The full data model for posts is described below:

| **property** | **type**                                                                | **nullable** | **description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

## Posting about content

At the core of the Hub Discussions API is the ability to create posts and drive conversation about data. This data can be a literal dataset, a feature in a dataset, an attribute of a feature of a dataset, or it could be an item, or a sentence in a pdf. The idea is that anything can be discussed with this platform. The property `post.discussion` expects a specifically formatted URI string to encapsulate the following information: the application context the post originated from (i.e. Hub, Urban), content type, content id, and optionally for datasets identification of specific layers, features, and attribute. The format allows posts to target coarsely-grained and highly-specific content. See the URI format and examples below:

```
# coarsely-grained
<application context>://<content type>/<content id>

# highly-specific
<application context>://dataset/<dataset id>_<layer id>?id=<feature id>&attribute=<feature attribute>

## examples

# commenting on item ab4
hub://item/ab4

# commenting on layer 1 of dataset 3ef
hub://dataset/3ef_1

# commenting on feature #5 of layer 1 of dataset 3ef
hub://dataset/3ef_1?id=5

# commenting on features #5 & #7
hub://dataset/3ef_1?id=5,7

# commenting on the species attribute of layer 1 of dataset 3ef
hub://dataset/3ef_1?attribute=species

# commenting on the species attributet of feature 5 of layer 1 of 3ef dataset
hub://dataset/3ef_1?id=5&attribute=species
```

## Replying to posts

A core tenet of any discussion system is the ability to reply to posts. Reply posts are just _posts_ using [createReply](https://esri.github.io/hub.js/api/discussions/createReply/), except they have a `postId` which links them to the "parent" post. All of the same validation for creating a post is applied when creating a reply.

Additionally, a reply post _cannot be more visible_ than the parent post. That is to say, a user cannot reply to a post from a private channel in a public channel; however, a user can reply to a post from a public channel in a private channel. As such, replies in private channels must be made to the same channel.

```js
import {
  createReply,
  ICreateReplyParams
  IPostOptions,
} from "@esri/hub-discussions";

const data: IPostOptions = {
  body: "I disagree, I do not like this dataset",
  discussion: "hub://dataset/1234",
};

const opts: ICreateReplyParams = { postId: "abcdefg", authentication, data };

const myReply = await createReply(opts);
/*
myPost = IPost {
  id: 'gjahsdkj',
  ...
}
*/
```

# Reactions

The Reaction model is not central to the objective of enabling in-app communication between ArcGIS Online users, but it offers users the ability to engage with posts in an expressive manner familiar to other popular collaboration platforms (think Slack, GitHub, MS Teams, etc). Reactions encode a user's sentiment ("thumbs up", "crying face", "thinking face", etc) onto a post [using emojis or symbols](https://esri.github.io/hub.js/api/discussions/PostReaction/).

## Creating reactions

If you want to show support for a post, you can add a thumbs up reaction:

```js
import {
  createReaction,
  ICreateReaction,
  ICreateReactionOptions,
  PostReaction,
} from "@esri/hub-discussions";

const params: ICreateReaction = {
  postId: "abd123",
  value: PostReaction.THUMBS_UP,
};

const opts: ICreateReactionOptions = { authentication, params };

const thumbs_up = await createReaction(opts);
```

# Searching Posts

In all of these examples, we created a post about Dataset ID 1234. These posts are linked to that dataset through the `params.discussion` property. If we wanted to search for posts about this dataset, the code would look something like this:

```js
import {
  searchPosts,
  ISearchPosts,
  ISearchPostsOptions,
} from "@esri/hub-discussions";

const params: ISearchPosts = {
  discussion: "hub://dataset/1234",
};

const opts: ISearchPostsOptions = { authentication, params };

const dataset1234Posts = await searchPosts(opts);
/*
dataset1234Posts = IPagedResponse<IPost> {
  items: [<IPost>, ...],
  total: 3,
  nextStart: -1
}
*/
```

## Expanded Search

This would return all posts about dataset 1234 in a general sense. But remember that the `discussion` parameter can point to layers, features, and attributes of datasets as well.

What if we wanted to find posts about any and every layer and feature included in the dataset, and not just general posts about the dataset? In the Discussions API, all string parameters utilize PostgreSQL's [LIKE operator](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.0/functions-matching.html) when performing queries, so the provided value is actually a pattern and can use % and \_ characters to match sequences and characters, respectively.

Note that this means any _actual_ percent signs or underscores must be backslash escaped. To return _every_ post about dataset 1234, we can change the example above to:

```js
import {
  searchPosts,
  ISearchPosts,
  ISearchPostsOptions,
} from "@esri/hub-discussions";

const params: ISearchPosts = {
  discussion: "%://dataset/1234%",
};

const opts: ISearchPostsOptions = { authentication, params };

const allDataset1234Posts = await searchPosts(opts);
/*
allDataset1234Posts = IPagedResponse<IPost> {
  items: [<IPost>, ...],
  total: 6,
  nextStart: -1
}
*/
```

## More Search Examples

The query above will return posts from all application contexts (instead of just `hub://`) and about any layer, feature, or attribute of that dataset.
Some other common query params are enumerated below:

```js
import { searchPosts, ISearchPosts, ISearchPostsOptions } from '@esri/hub-discussions';

// search for posts by jdoe made in hub about dataset 1234
const params: ISearchPosts = {
  creator: 'jdoe'
  discussion: 'hub://dataset/1234',
};

// search for posts about trees that are replies to post abcdefg
const params: ISearchPosts = {
  body: '%trees%',
  parents: 'abcdefg'
};

// search for posts about trees in team channels only
const params: ISearchPosts = {
  body: '%trees%',
  access: 'private'
};
```

Searchable properties are enumerated on the [`ISearchPosts`](https://esri.github.io/hub.js/api/discussions/ISearchPosts/) interface. All properties that are type `string` can leverage the LIKE operator shown in the previous examples.

# Channels

Discussions are shared with users through Channels -- Channels are the mechanism that determine whether a user can view or reply to a channel's posts.

Channels are configured with permissions properties for who can view or create posts:

- `channel.access` specifies who can view the channel's posts. It uses the ArcGIS Portal model for **[sharing access](https://esri.github.io/hub.js/api/discussions/SharingAccess/)**, **groups**, and **orgs**. Possible values include `private`, `org` and `public`
- `channel.groups` is an optional array of ArcGIS Online Group ID for users who can create posts or view `access = private` channels.
- `channel.orgs` is an optional array of ArcGIS Online Organization ID for users who can create posts or view `access = private` channels.

Combining these three fields results in a flexible configuration that can make discussion content interactable to a select few users or widely visible to an entire organization or open to the public.

## Basic channel configuration

A channel describes a channel model where `channel.access: 'private'` and the groups array contains a single [ArcGIS Online group](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/share-maps/groups.htm) ID, `channel.groups: ['someGroupId']` (By default, `channel.orgs` is populated with the channel-creating user's org ID). In effect, any posts that belong to this channel can be viewed and responded to by members of `'someGroupId'` group only. In the first iteration of Hub Discussions, we will limit users to only create "team" channels.

Following along, other channel types not yet implemented will include "shared", "org", and "public". A "shared" channel will be similar to a "team" channel, except that its `channel.groups` array includes more than one group ID, enabling collaboration between members of multiple teams. An "org" channel will consist of `channel.access: 'org'` and `channel.orgs: ['someOrgId]`, and only members of `'someOrgId'` organization will be granted access to engage with discussion content related to it. Finally, "public" channels are configured using `channel.access: 'public'` and `channel.orgs: ['someOrgId']`, and while only members of `'someOrgId'` can author content in the channel anyone can view its discussions posts.

```js
// Simple channel configurations
import { IChannel } from '@esri/hub-discussions';

// team channel
const teamChannel: IChannel = {
  access: 'private',
  orgs: ['myUserOrg'],
  groups: ['someGroupId'],
  ...
};

// shared channel
const sharedChannel: IChannel = {
  access: 'private',
  orgs: ['myUserOrg'],
  groups: ['someGroupId', 'someOtherGroupId'],
  ...
};

// org channel
const orgChannel: IChannel = {
  access: 'org',
  orgs: ['myUserOrg'],
  groups: [],
  ...
};

// cross-org channel? (tbd)
const xOrgChannel: IChannel = {
  access: 'org',
  orgs: ['myUserOrg', 'someOtherOrgId'],
  groups: [],
  ...
};

// public channel
const publicChannel: IChannel = {
  access: 'public',
  orgs: ['myUserOrg'],
  groups: [],
  ...
};
```

## Advanced channel configuration

Channels include some advanced configurations that set the "rules of engagement" for the discourse that occurs within it. These settings are outlined below:

| blockWords        | string[]                                                                      | []          | Array of words or phrases that should trigger moderation. Not yet implemented in API.                                                 |

## Moderation

Channels can only be created by an "administrator"-like user. For "team" channels, that is the ArcGIS Online **group owner** or a **group manager**. For "org" and "public" channels, that is a user with the **"Administrator" role**. Similarly, these channel creators are effectively channel **moderators**, and are granted the ability to hide, obscure, and delete other user's posts at their discretion. Only moderators can update [**`post.status`**](https://esri.github.io/hub.js/api/discussions/PostStatus/) -- non-moderators can only view posts where `post.status` equals `'approved'`.

# Authentication and Authorization

All requests to the Hub Discussions API rely on ArcGIS Online for authentication.

In the `@esri/hub-discussions` library, authentication is handled using the familiar [`IHubRequestOptions`](https://esri.github.io/hub.js/api/common/IHubRequestOptions/#authentication) interface, and specifically the [`UserSession`](https://esri.github.io/arcgis-rest-js/api/auth/UserSession/) instance attached to it.

A user's access to content stored in the Discussions API is determined by their platform identity -- that is their organization and group memberships and manage roles. As noted above, ArcGIS Online access and permissions are encoded in Channels. Currently, most API methods employ one or many checks comparing Channel specs to the requesting user's identity.

A summary of authorization checks are in the table below ([source code](https://github.com/Esri/hub.js/blob/master/packages/discussions/src/utils/channels.ts)):

# In Conclusion

The Hub Discussions API has only begun to expose the numerous ways users can interact with each other around data and content in Hub. The API is under continuous development. The `@esri/hub-discussions` package provides a familar Hub.js interface to the API. There is much more that can be done with the Discussions API and library than what is expressed in this guide. Please add an issue to this repo if you have any questions or if something does not work as expected.
