### API Reference

The documentation is published at http://esri.github.io/hub.js/ (source code [here](/docs/src)).

### Instructions

You can install dependencies by cloning the repository and running:

```bash
npm install
```

**Note:** This project uses [volta](https://volta.sh/) to manage node/npm versions. We strongly suggest you do, too :)

Afterward, for a list of all available commands run `npm run`.

Some useful commands include:

- `npm test` runs _all_ the tests and confirms the API is functioning as expected.
- There is also a `Debug Node Tests` configuration in the `.vscode/launch.json` which will run the Node tests in the VS Code debugger.
- `npm run test:chrome:debug` runs _all_ the tests in a browser, and will re-run when changes are made. Note: in some situations, spies/stubs will fail on subsequent test runs. We are not certain why this occurs, but the resolution is to stop/start the test runner.
- `npm run docs:serve` will run the documentation site locally at http://localhost:3000
- `npm run build` will run the ESM and CJS build for _all_ the packages

### Design Philosophy

`hub.js` is designed as a set of data manipulation functions, not persistent objects with behavior. You should not use `new` in conjunction with this library. Just include the modules your application needs and use them to hide lower-level abstractions for making API calls for hub related things. Your application should manage the state of the data you receive from these methods.

This project builds on the packages in [`arcgis-rest-js`](https://esri.github.io/arcgis-rest-js), so if you want even lower-level access, you can also use them directly.

#### Why Not Objects?

Persistent objects often introduce memory leaks in JavaScript applications. As soon as you instantiate a `new` object, you need to consider its lifespan. If you happen to assign that object inside a closure or somewhere else long-lived, you might end up with references that cannot be destroyed by the garbage collector. Creating clean separation between _functions-that-fetch-or-manipulate-data_ and _application-state-as-a-javascript-object_ helps to avoid this problem.

We are aiming for _functional_ equivalence to [`hub-py`](https://github.com/esridc/hub-py) so that the objects and capabilities are familiar, not necessarily to make the APIs _identical_.
