# @esri/hub-search

> Module to search for ArcGIS items and format them for display in ArcGIS Hub.

### Example

```bash
npm install @esri/hub-search
```

# Use in frontend

```js
import { serialize } from '@esri/hub-search';

// Search query params that ArcGIS Hub expects
const params = {
  q: 'crime',
  sort: 'name',
  agg: { fields: 'tags,collection,owner,source,hasApi,downloadable' },
  start: 1,
  num: 10
}
const token = 'xxxYYY' // AGO token
const portal = 'https://qaext.arcgis.com/sharing/rest'
const headers = { authorization: token, portal }
const serializedParams = arcgisHub.serialize(params)
// Query hub v3's new search endpoint
fetch(`hub.arcgis.com/api/v3/search?${serializedParams}`, { headers })
```

# Use in backend

```js
const { agoSearch } = require('@esri/hub-search')
// req.query has deserialized query parameters
// req.headers.authorization has token
agoSearch(req.query, req.headers.authorization, req.headers.portal)
```
