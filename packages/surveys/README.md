# @esri/hub-surveys

> Module to interact with ArcGIS Hub Surveys in Node.js and modern browsers.

### Example

```bash
npm install @esri/hub-surveys
```

```js
import { setAccess } from "@esri/hub-surveys";

// Sets a Survey Form, Feature Service & Fieldworker View (if it exists) access
// Stakeholder View access is set separately
setAccess(
  formModel, // { item: { ... }, data?: { ... } }
  "private", // "private", "public", or "org"
  requestOptions // rest.js request options
)
  .then((results) => {
    // results is an array containing the rest.js setAccess result for each
    // survey item whose access we successfully changed
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // one or more rest.js setItemAccess calls failed. error is first
    // encountered error. all successful setItemAccess calls have automatically
    // been reverted at this point
  });
```

```js
import { shareWithGroup } from "@esri/hub-surveys";

// Shares Survey items with the given group ID. Transactional in nature.
shareWithGroup(
  formModel, // { item: { ... }, data?: { ... } }
  "9a2fea7edecc47eb9818b4f5a220ee71", // ID of group to share Survey items to
  requestOptions // rest.js request options
)
  .then((results) => {
    // all rest.js shareItemWithGroup calls succeeded. results is an array of
    // rest.js shareItemWithGroup results.
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // one or more rest.js shareItemWithGroup calls failed. error is first
    // encountered error. all successful shareItemWithGroup calls have automatically
    // been reverted at this point
  });
```

```js
import { unshareWithGroup } from "@esri/hub-surveys";

// Unshares Survey items with the given group ID. Transactional in nature.
unshareWithGroup(
  formModel, // { item: { ... }, data?: { ... } }
  "9a2fea7edecc47eb9818b4f5a220ee71", // ID of group to share Survey items to
  requestOptions // rest.js request options
)
  .then((results) => {
    // all rest.js unshareItemWithGroup calls succeeded. results is an array of
    // rest.js unshareItemWithGroup results.
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // one or more rest.js unshareItemWithGroup calls failed. error is first
    // encountered error. all successful unshareItemWithGroup calls have automatically
    // been reverted at this point
  });
```
